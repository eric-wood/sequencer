# Sequencer

A simple little MIDI sequencer to keep Eric from buying more music equipment he doesn't need.

(why spend money on it if you can build it yourself?)

### Objective

- Hit record
- Play a few notes (timing doesn't matter, just key presses!)
- Hit stop
- Hit play!
- Listen to your notes get played back
- Adjust the speed
- ?????
- Repeat

Here's an [example](http://youtu.be/Rl28UCNWSig?t=39s) of the concept I'm going for (and something I'm sure a lot of you have heard before)

### Running it

[Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/) is kinda weird about stuff in its current JRuby stage and requires that nifty little helper program to run.

Give this a shot:

```bash
shoes bin/sequencer.rb
```

That's it!

### More info

Stay tuned! Eventually I'm going to try doing a writeup on this once it's in a workable state!
